A test case repo that shows how the java-gearman-service project fails to 
cleanup after itself when shutdown is called if you make both a worker and 
client service.

To run you need javac and java and a local gearmand running, 
then run the following scripts:

./build
./run

Run will output the jstack of the java process that should have completed but
fails to stop because of the bug.
